An interesting challenge about creating a sky look-alike website.

## Initial considerations

The challenge is aimed to make a completely new landing page in approximately 3 calendar days. Considering that Bootstrap 4 has been incorporated in the original website, this project will only be using CSS to demonstrate how to obtain the same results without a styling framework.

Webpack played an important role in the project because I wantend to bundle multiple files (CSS, JS) into one, to avoid using any heavy weight JS framework.
